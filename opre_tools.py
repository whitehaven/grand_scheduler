    """Filters an isolated sub-sequence of variables assined to True.

    Extract the span of Boolean variables [start, start + length), negate them,
    and if there is variables to the left/right of this span, surround the span by
    them in non negated form.

    Args:
      works: a list of variables to extract the span from.
      start: the start to the span.
      length: the length of the span.

    Returns:
      a list of variables which conjunction will be false if the sub-list is
      assigned to True, and correctly bounded by variables assigned to False,
      or by the start or end of works.
